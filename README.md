Gwilym's dotfiles
=================

This is a repository containing all of my dotfiles I currently use on my
system. Most are borrowed from other places or people who have very good
ideas. Please realise that some of the settings I have may only make
sense on a dvorak keyboard so if you are using these files, bare that in mind.
I will add a quick install script later.
